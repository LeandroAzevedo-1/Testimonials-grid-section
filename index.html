        <h4 class="first-article-descrition">I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current,
          if not more so,
          in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.
        </h4>
        <p class="first-article-text">“ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to
          make a
          transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up
          for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.
          The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing
          the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”</p>

        <h4 class="third-article-descrition">Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</h4>

        <p class="third-article-text">“ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some
          structure from
          professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
          student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff
          did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team
          project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial
          could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent
          experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers.
          100% recommend! ”</p>

          gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable
